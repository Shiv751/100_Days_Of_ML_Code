### Day 2: January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Understood the basic concepts of handling multidimentional arrays in python using numpy

**Thoughts**: Numpy is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. If you are already familiar with MATLAB, you might find this tutorial useful to get started with Numpy.

### Day 3: January 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Got insights about how to plot your data for better understanding. Gone through basics of matplotlib library

**Thoughts**: Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.
